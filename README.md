Additionally, there are selectable elements for using with interactive screens. These are buttons, option pickers and even text input.

## Colors & CharFormat
The Color struct used is from the library [AshLib](https://github.com/siljamdev/AshLib)  
Also, the CharFormat is used, that allows for bold, italic, strike-through, underlined and colored text, with ANSI escape sequences. This class is too from the library [AshLib](https://github.com/siljamdev/AshLib)
